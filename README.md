# Yahoo-Weather-Website
web develop
Become familiar with the AJAX, JSON & XML technologies.
• Use a combination of HTML, CSS, DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XML and Java Servlets.
• Get hands-on experience in Amazon cloud computing (AWS)
• Get hands-on experience on how to use YUI library to beautify a web page
• Provide an interface to perform weather search from Yahoo! and post details to
Facebook.

Allow a user to enter a “query” to get weather information from Yahoo!; the query will
contain a location which can be a city name with state or country, or a ZIP code. Your
JavaScript code will have to determine the location type from the location input. If the
user intends to input a city name, then state or country should be provided as well. For
example: Los Angeles, CA, USA or Seattle, WA or Pasadena, USA are three valid
inputs. The default temperature unit is Fahrenheit;
• Use the query string to retrieve appropriate information from Yahoo!, using a modified
PHP script from Homework #6. The PHP script must run on AWS, instead of csserver.
usc.edu;
• Display the current weather details, along with a table showing five-day weather forecast.
The big city name should be clickable and link to rss feed page. The underlined
temperature unit should be clickable and perform the unit changing function (see Figure
3). For this homework, display the weather information of only the first location (woeid)
returned by Yahoo! Geolocation service;
• On the right side of the weather information, there should be a Facebook button, which
allows the user to select to post either the current weather condition or the weather
forecast to his/her Facebook wall;
• Authorize the user to login to Facebook;
• Post a feed of the weather information to the user’s Facebook wall using the Facebook
Connect API.
